      <h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
      
      <p>
        To understand what we are attempting to do (and why) we must hold a few truths to be non-negotiable.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>(1)</strong> The primary use case for crypto is to be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>peer-to-peer electronic cash</li>
        <li>a system to store, hold and transfer value irrespective of borders and governments</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>(2)</strong> Bitcoin is the most prominent attempt at establishing such a system. Having gained widespread acceptance, it is here to stay for a while. It will continue to be acquirable to most people on this planet for the foreseeable future.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>(3)</strong> Privacy is the most important aspect of any peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Without it fungibility cannot be achieved. Bitcoin's public ledger severely lacks in this regard.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>(4)</strong> Monero is currently the best attempt at a better system (by far). Monero is the best choice because it:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>offers reasonably private transactions through ring signatures and bulletproofs</li>
        <li>enforces non-transparent uniform transactions</li>
        <li>has the largest user base of any privacy coin (by far), giving it the largest possible anonymity set</li>
        <li>has gained widespread adoption in circles where privacy is paramount</li>
        <li>has shown to be eager and willing to adopt new technology (e.g FCMP++)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>(5)</strong> Monero is under constant attack. Be it by chainalysis companies or governments. It lives under the constant threat of delistings. It is not unreasonable to assume that it will be banned from most exchanges within the next 3-5 years.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>(6)</strong> We cannot rely on centralized exchanges. Governments will continue to crack down against Monero. Centralized entities will fold under pressure because they do not want to go to prison, and they need to stay profitable. This will impact the ability to onboard new users to the network if the community does not develop a reliable onramp that does not rely on the continued functioning of these institutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Therefore any onramp <strong>must</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>be non-custodial</li>
        <li>be censorship resistant</li>
        <li>provide radical privacy</li>
        <li>have high liquidity</li>
      </ul>
