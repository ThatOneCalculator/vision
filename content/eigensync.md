## What is _eigensync_?

- It is a protocol developed just for the _eigenwallet_.
- It stores wallet state in the cloud in a secure way.
- It also synchronizes that state across different devices with the same seed.

## What can it do?

It allows us to do cool stuff like:

- Perform blockchain synchronization once on your laptop. Open the same wallet
  on your iPhone. <br>You can immediately see the full wallet balance. Skipping
  the painful sync progress on the iPhone.
- Initiate a swap on your iPhone. Lock your Bitcoin. Resume it later on your
  laptop when the other party has locked their Monero.
- Restore a Monero wallet after a year of inactivity on a new device. You forgot
  the restore height. You enter your seed and the wallet fully syncs within
  seconds.
- You have a server at home which you use to run a _Monero node_. You install
  the _eigennode_ on the same machine. The _eigennode_ does the heavy lifting of
  scanning the entire blockchain for your transactions. Your iPhone connects to
  it and you get _MyMonero_ like ease of use but with complete privacy.
